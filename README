The Hollow Crown - Quest Starting Locations
-------------------------------------------

Note: I'm adding this as I was not able to add all player helpers I wanted to add therfore it can be slightly confusing when a quest was added or if triggering a certain dialogue option triggers a quest

Note: If stuck during a quest simply check the journal and check what current object is
