  dialogueText: Ashwick is a village holding its breath. Doors are barred. Windows
    are shuttered. The few souls you pass keep their eyes down, hurrying past like
    you carry plague. A dry fountain stands in the square, its stone saint weathered
    faceless. Beyond the twisted trees of the Thornwood, the black spires of Castle
    Valdros claw at the clouds. Something is very wrong here. But wrong things often
    pay well.
