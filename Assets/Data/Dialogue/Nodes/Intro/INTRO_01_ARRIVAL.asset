  dialogueText: "The road to Ashwick ends in mud and silence. You've traveled for
    days following rumors\u2014whispers of a cursed king, a dying kingdom, and opportunities
    for those brave or foolish enough to seek them. Now, standing at the edge of
    this grey village beneath an overcast sky, you wonder if the stories were true.
    The air smells of rot and woodsmoke. Somewhere, a crow calls."
