  dialogueText: "The road to Ashwick ends in mud and silence. You've followed rumors
    for weeks \u2014 whispers of a mad king, a cursed crown, and a kingdom rotting
    from within. Some seek to save it. Others seek to profit from its fall. You haven't
    decided which you are yet. The village lies ahead, grey and huddled beneath a
    grey sky. Smoke rises from a single chimney."
