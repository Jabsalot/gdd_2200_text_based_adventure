  dialogueText: Ashwick is a village holding its breath. The few people you pass
    avoid your gaze, hurrying about their business with hunched shoulders. Buildings
    stand empty, doors hanging open. A notice board near the central fountain is
    covered in desperate pleas. In the distance, beyond twisted trees, you can just
    make out the dark spires of Castle Valdros against the iron sky. Whatever happened
    here, the castle is at the heart of it.
