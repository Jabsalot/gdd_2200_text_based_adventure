  dialogueText: They see you coming. They see Callum's blood. Thomas tries to shield
    Elena. Elena screams for the Saint. Neither works. Thomas dies reaching for his
    prayer beads. Elena dies holding them. Their blood mixes with Callum's. Three
    deaths. Three innocents. The Seer's chains will break now. You tell yourself
    it's worth it. The Pale Saint watches with his missing face, and keeps his judgment
    to himself.
