  speakerName: Ser Roderick
  dialogueText: He pulls back his hood, revealing a face marked by old scars and
    fresh worry. "I am Ser Roderick of the King's Guard. Twenty years I served Aldric.
    Twenty years." His jaw tightens. "I was there when the curse took hold. Watched
    him change, day by day, as that damned crown ate away at everything he was. I
    fled when I should have fought. Now I'm trying to make it right."
