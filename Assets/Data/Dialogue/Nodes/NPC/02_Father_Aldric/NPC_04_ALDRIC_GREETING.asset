  dialogueText: The priest doesn't look up as you approach. His vestments are stained,
    his beard unkempt, his eyes fixed on the bottle before him. "If you're here for
    absolution, find another priest. If you're here for wisdom, find another bottle.
    And if you're here to kill me..." He finally looks up, and his eyes are sharper
    than they have any right to be. "...get in line."
