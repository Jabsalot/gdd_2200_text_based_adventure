  dialogueText: "His hands tremble as he takes the vial of blood, the container of
    eyes. \"You found them. Saints preserve us, you actually found them.\" He stands
    \u2014 steadier than you've ever seen him. \"The ritual is simple but must be
    performed in the king's presence.\" He teaches you phrases in a language that
    hurts to hear. \"Hold the blood in one hand, the eyes in the other. Speak the
    words. The crown will fight. But hold until it's done.\" He grips your shoulder.
    \"I can show you a path to the castle. Go. Save our king.\""
