  dialogueText: For a moment, hope flickers in his bloodshot eyes. "Then the king
    may yet be saved. Find the blood and the eyes. Bring them to me, and I'll teach
    you the ritual. Brother Callum at the chapel has the keys you'll need." He pushes
    the bottle away. "I've spent years drowning in guilt. Maybe this is my chance
    to do something worthwhile. Don't let me down, stranger."
