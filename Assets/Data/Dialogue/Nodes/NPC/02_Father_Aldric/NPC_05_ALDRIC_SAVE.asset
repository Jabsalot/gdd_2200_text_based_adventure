  dialogueText: "For the first time, the priest sets down his bottle. \"Save him?
    Maybe. There's a ritual \u2014 old, older than the church. It can break the crown's
    hold.\" He leans closer. \"But the components... they're not easy. The Blood
    of the Lost Lamb \u2014 preserved in the crypt beneath the chapel. An innocent
    sacrificed during the church's dark days. And the Eyes of the Blind Seer \u2014
    taken from the heretic Moira. They're kept in the chapel's relics room.\" His
    voice hardens. \"It won't be clean. But it might work. Are you willing to rob
    the dead to save the living?\""
