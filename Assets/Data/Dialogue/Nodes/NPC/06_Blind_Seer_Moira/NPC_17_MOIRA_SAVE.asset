  dialogueText: '"Save him?" She laughs cruelly. "The king is beyond saving. The
    crown has eaten everything he was." She pauses. "But if you''re determined to
    try, you''ll need my eyes. The church kept them as relics. Blood and eyes, mixed
    with the right words, can burn away the crown''s corruption." Her voice sharpens.
    "But you''ll do it without me. And when it fails, remember I offered you a better
    path."'
