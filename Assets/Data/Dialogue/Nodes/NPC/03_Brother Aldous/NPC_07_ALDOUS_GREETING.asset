  dialogueText: "The robed figure turns slowly. His face might have been kind once,
    but now it's gaunt and pale, with eyes that seem to look through you rather than
    at you. A smile spreads across his lips\u2014too wide, too knowing. \"Ah. A seeker.
    I wondered when you would come. The void whispered of your arrival.\" His voice
    is soft, almost gentle. \"What brings you to this broken house of worship, child?\""
