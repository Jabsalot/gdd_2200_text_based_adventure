  dialogueText: '"Corruption?" He laughs softly. "Is it corruption when a caterpillar
    becomes a butterfly? When a seed splits to become a tree? The king suffers because
    he resists. He clings to his humanity like a drowning man clinging to a stone."
    Aldous steps closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. "But you... you could embrace
    it. Take the crown''s power for yourself. Become something greater than human.
    All it requires is the will to drink deep from the source."'
