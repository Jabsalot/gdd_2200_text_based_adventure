  dialogueText: "The moment he sees the medallion, Aldous recoils as if struck. His
    composure cracks, revealing something fearful beneath. \"Where did you\u2014that
    thing should have been destroyed!\" He raises a hand to shield his eyes from
    it. \"Keep it away from me. The saint's light... it burns. It remembers what
    I was.\" For a moment, the man he used to be surfaces in his eyes\u2014terrified,
    trapped. Then it's gone, replaced by hatred. \"You'll never save him. The crown
    is too strong. All you'll do is die.\""
