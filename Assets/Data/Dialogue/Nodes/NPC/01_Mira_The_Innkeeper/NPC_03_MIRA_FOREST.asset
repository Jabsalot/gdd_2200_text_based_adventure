  dialogueText: Her voice drops. "There's a hermit who lives at the edge. Rook. Used
    to be the royal executioner until he refused to kill the queen. Dangerous man,
    but he knows things." She hesitates. "And deeper in the forest... they say there's
    a witch. A seer. The church blinded her and locked her away decades ago, but
    she's still alive down there. Still watching without eyes."
