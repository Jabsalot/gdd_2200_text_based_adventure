  dialogueText: The innkeeper sets down her glass and studies you with eyes that
    have seen too much and expect worse. "A traveler. We don't get many of those
    anymore. Most folk run from Ashwick, not toward it." She gestures at the empty
    room. "As you can see, business is booming. What brings you to our dying little
    corner of the kingdom?"
