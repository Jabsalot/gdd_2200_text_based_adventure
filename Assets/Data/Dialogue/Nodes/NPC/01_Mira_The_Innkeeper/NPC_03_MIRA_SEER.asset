  dialogueText: '"The Blind Seer. Moira." Her voice is barely a whisper. "She was
    an oracle. The most powerful the kingdom ever knew. Until she prophesied the
    Hollow Crown would destroy everything. The church called it heresy. They took
    her eyes and locked her away." She shivers. "But taking her eyes didn''t stop
    her seeing. Some say she''s still down there, watching, waiting for someone foolish
    enough to set her free. Don''t be that person, stranger."'
