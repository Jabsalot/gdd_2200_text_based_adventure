  dialogueText: "The blade is heavier than it looks, but it cuts clean. Rook's eyes
    find yours as the steel swings, and in that final moment, you see gratitude.
    He falls slowly, peacefully, the first peace he's known in years. His blood soaks
    into the earth, into your hands. You feel it \u2014 the willing sacrifice. Something
    has changed. Something that will let you take a crown."
