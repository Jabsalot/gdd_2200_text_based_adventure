  dialogueText: The door opens before you knock, revealing a massive man with a face
    like weathered stone. Scars cross his features. He's missing two fingers on his
    left hand. His eyes are empty, patient, utterly without fear. "Saw you coming.
    Don't get visitors. Don't want them." He doesn't move to welcome you. "What do
    you want?"
