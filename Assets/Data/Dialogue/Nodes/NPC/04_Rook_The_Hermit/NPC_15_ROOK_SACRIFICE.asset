  dialogueText: "He closes his eyes, almost peaceful. \"Thank you.\" He rises and
    enters the hut, returning with a heavy blade \u2014 black iron, worn smooth.
    \"My executioner's blade. It's taken more heads than I can count. Now it'll take
    one more.\" He kneels, offering his neck. \"Do it clean. And when you take the
    crown... make it mean something.\""
