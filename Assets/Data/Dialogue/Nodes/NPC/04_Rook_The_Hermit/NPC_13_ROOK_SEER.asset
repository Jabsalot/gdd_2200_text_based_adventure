  dialogueText: His expression darkens. "The witch in the woods. Moira. She's real.
    Imprisoned beneath the Thornwood, chained with blessed iron." He leans against
    the doorframe. "I know where she is. I've heard her whispering on moonless nights."
    He studies you. "Why do you want to know? Looking to free her? That would be
    a terrible mistake."
