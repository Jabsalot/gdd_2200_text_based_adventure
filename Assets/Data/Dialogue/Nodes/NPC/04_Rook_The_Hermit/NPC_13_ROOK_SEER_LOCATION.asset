  dialogueText: 'He sighs. "You''ll go whether I help you or not." He produces a
    rusted iron key. "Follow the path into the Thornwood. When you reach the three
    dead oaks, turn west. There''s a passage beneath the largest stone. The key opens
    the cell." He presses it into your hand. "Whatever she offers you, remember:
    the Seer doesn''t give gifts. She makes investments. And she always collects."'
