  dialogueText: Her voice drops to a whisper. "That's Ser Roderick. Used to be the
    king's champion, if you can believe it. Fled the castle when things went bad.
    Now he sits in that corner every night, nursing his ale and his guilt." She pauses.
    "He's looking for help, I think. Someone willing to try what he couldn't do alone.
    Save the king, break the curse. Noble fool."
