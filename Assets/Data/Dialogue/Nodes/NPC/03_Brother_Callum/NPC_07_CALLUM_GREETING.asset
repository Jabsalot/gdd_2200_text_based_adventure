  dialogueText: The young priest rises from his prayers, a nervous smile on his face.
    He can't be more than twenty. "A visitor! Praise the Saint. We don't see many
    travelers anymore." His enthusiasm feels forced, desperate. "How can I help you?
    Are you here to pray? To confess? The Saint welcomes all."
