  dialogueText: His face pales. "The Lost Lamb. It's not something we talk about."
    He lowers his voice. "Centuries ago, the church performed a sacrifice. A child.
    They called it 'giving the Lamb to the Saint.'" He looks ill. "The blood was
    preserved. It's still down there. I've seen it. I wish I hadn't." He presses
    the key into your hands. "Don't touch that blood. Nothing good can come from
    it."
