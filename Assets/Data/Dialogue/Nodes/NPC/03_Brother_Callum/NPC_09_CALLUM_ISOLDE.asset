  dialogueText: His expression softens. "Queen Isolde. A good woman." He sighs. "When
    the king ordered her execution, someone smuggled her body here, hid her in the
    crypt in an unmarked alcove." He meets your eyes. "If you're looking to pay respects,
    look for the wilted flowers. Someone still remembers her."
