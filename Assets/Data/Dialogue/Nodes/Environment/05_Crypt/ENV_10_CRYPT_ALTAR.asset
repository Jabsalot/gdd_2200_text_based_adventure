  dialogueText: "The altar is carved with spiraling symbols that hurt to look at
    directly. Old bloodstains darken the stone. Resting in a groove at the altar's
    center is a dagger of black iron, its blade etched with the same maddening patterns.
    The metal seems to drink the torchlight. This is no ordinary weapon\u2014it was
    made to kill something that refuses to die."
