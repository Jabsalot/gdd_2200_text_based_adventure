  dialogueText: "The notice board is a collage of misery. Missing persons notices
    \u2014 dozens of them, faces faded by rain. A royal decree, torn and stained,
    demands \"all traitors to the crown present themselves for judgment.\" Someone
    has scrawled beneath it: \"The king sees enemies in shadows.\" A newer notice
    warns travelers to avoid the Thornwood after dark. At the very bottom, in fresh
    ink: \"She still watches. She still waits.\""
