  dialogueText: "The fountain has been dry for years. The Pale Saint stands with
    arms outstretched, a chalice raised to heaven \u2014 but where the face should
    be, there's only smooth, scarred stone. Some say the saint wept when the king's
    madness began, and the tears wore away the features. Others say the villagers
    did it themselves, unable to bear those merciful eyes watching their suffering."
