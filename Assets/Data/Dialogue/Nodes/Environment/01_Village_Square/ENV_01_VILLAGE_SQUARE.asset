  speakerName: Ashwick Village Square
  dialogueText: "The heart of Ashwick is a muddy square dominated by a cracked stone
    fountain. The statue atop it once depicted the Pale Saint, but the face has been
    worn away by time \u2014 or scratched away by hands. A weathered notice board
    leans beside it, covered in desperate papers. The only signs of life are the
    Weeping Widow Inn to the north and the chapel's spire to the east."
