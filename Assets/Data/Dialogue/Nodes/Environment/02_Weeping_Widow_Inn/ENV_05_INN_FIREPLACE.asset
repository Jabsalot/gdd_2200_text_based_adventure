  dialogueText: "The fire is almost dead, more ember than flame. A few logs sit beside
    it, but no one has bothered to add them. Above the mantle hangs a faded portrait
    \u2014 a man in royal regalia, stern but not unkind. King Aldric, you realize,
    before the madness. Before the crown hollowed him out. Someone has drawn a black
    X across his face in charcoal."
