  dialogueText: "You place Rook's dried flowers beside the wilted ones. They're humble
    things \u2014 wildflowers from the Thornwood edge, pressed and preserved. But
    they mean something. Rook couldn't save the queen. He couldn't even bury her
    properly. But he could ask a stranger to bring her flowers. It's not enough.
    It will never be enough. But it's something. The grave seems somehow lighter
    now."
