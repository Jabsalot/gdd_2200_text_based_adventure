  dialogueText: "Bones upon bones, stacked in alcoves like library shelves. Skulls
    grin at you from the darkness, empty eyes tracking your torch. These are the
    faithful dead \u2014 generations of Ashwick's devout, waiting for a resurrection
    that seems less likely with each passing year. Some died peacefully. Some didn't.
    You can tell by the cracks in their skulls, the chains still wrapped around their
    wrists."
