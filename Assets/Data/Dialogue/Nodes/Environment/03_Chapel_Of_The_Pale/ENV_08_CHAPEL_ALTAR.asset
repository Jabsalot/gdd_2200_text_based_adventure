  dialogueText: "The altar is ancient stone, carved with spiraling prayers in a language
    older than the kingdom. Dark stains mark its surface \u2014 old blood, never
    fully cleaned. The Pale Saint's icon has been torn down, leaving only an empty
    frame. Someone has placed fresh flowers before it anyway. Faith persists even
    when its symbols fail."
