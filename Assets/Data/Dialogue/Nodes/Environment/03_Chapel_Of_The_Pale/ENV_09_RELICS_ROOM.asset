  dialogueText: "A small chamber lined with shelves. Most are empty now \u2014 relics
    sold or stolen during lean years. What remains is modest: a saint's finger bone
    in a glass case, a fragment of blessed cloth, prayer beads worn smooth by generations
    of hands. But there, in the corner, a silver box catches the light. It's older
    than the others, its surface etched with warning signs."
