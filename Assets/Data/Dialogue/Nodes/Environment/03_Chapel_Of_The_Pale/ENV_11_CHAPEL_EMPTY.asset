  dialogueText: "The chapel is silent now. Three bodies lie where they fell \u2014
    Brother Callum before the altar, the acolytes in the pews. Blood pools on the
    ancient stones, seeping into cracks that have seen such offerings before. The
    candles still burn. The Pale Saint still watches with his missing face. If there
    is judgment for what you've done, it doesn't come from here."
