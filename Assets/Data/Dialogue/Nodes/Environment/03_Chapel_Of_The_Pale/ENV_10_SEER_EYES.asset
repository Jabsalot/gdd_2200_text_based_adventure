  dialogueText: "Inside the silver box, preserved in clouded fluid, float two human
    eyes. They're milky white, unseeing, yet you could swear they turn to follow
    your movements. A faded label reads: \"The Eyes of the Heretic Moira \u2014 taken
    in service to the Saint, that her false visions might be silenced.\" These are
    the Seer's eyes. Taken decades ago. Still watching."
