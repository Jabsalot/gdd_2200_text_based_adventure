  dialogueText: "The hut is cold now. The fire has died. The weapons still hang on
    the walls, but their owner is gone \u2014 his blood on your hands, his blade
    in your pack, his sacrifice weighing on your soul. The shelf where the flowers
    once rested is empty. You took them to the queen's grave, as he asked. It was
    the least you could do. It was nothing compared to what he gave."
