  dialogueText: "The hut is larger inside than it appears, but still cramped. Weapons
    hang from every wall \u2014 axes, swords, hooks, things you don't have names
    for. Tools of execution, collected over a lifetime of killing. A small fire burns
    in the hearth. A bed of straw sits in the corner. And on a shelf, carefully preserved,
    a bundle of dried wildflowers tied with black ribbon. He's been preparing these
    for a while."
