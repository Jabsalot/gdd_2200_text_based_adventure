  speakerName: Ashwick Village Square
  dialogueText: The heart of Ashwick is a muddy square dominated by a cracked stone
    fountain, long dry. Crows circle overhead, and the few villagers move with hunched
    shoulders, avoiding eye contact. A weathered notice board stands near the fountain,
    covered in desperate pleas and faded warnings.
