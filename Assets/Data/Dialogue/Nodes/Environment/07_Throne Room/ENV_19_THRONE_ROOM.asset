  speakerName: Castle Valdros - Throne Room
  dialogueText: The great hall of Castle Valdros is a ruin of its former glory. Tattered
    banners hang from the vaulted ceiling. At the far end, upon the iron throne,
    sits King Aldric, his crown askew on his fevered brow. Black veins spread visibly
    across his skin. The Hollow Crown rests heavy on his head, the source of the
    curse that consumes him. He raises his head slowly, eyes burning with unnatural
    light.
