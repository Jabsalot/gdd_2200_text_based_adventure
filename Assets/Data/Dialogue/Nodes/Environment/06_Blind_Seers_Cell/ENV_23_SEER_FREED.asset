  speakerName: The Blind Seer's Cell
  dialogueText: The chains lie broken on the stone floor, still smoking from the
    blood that unmade them. The Seer stands now, stretching limbs that haven't moved
    freely in decades. She's smaller than you expected. Frailer. But when she turns
    toward you, her empty face somehow seeing, you feel the weight of something ancient
    and hungry pressing against your mind. "You've done well, child. Now. Let me
    give you your reward."
