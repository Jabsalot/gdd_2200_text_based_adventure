  dialogueText: "The executioner's blade feels right in your hand \u2014 balanced,
    patient, eager. Rook's blood still stains its edge, freely given, still warm
    with sacrifice. You cross the throne room in three strides. The king doesn't
    resist. Maybe he can't. Maybe he won't. The blade takes his head in one clean
    stroke. The crown tumbles from his skull and rolls across the floor, coming to
    rest at your feet. It pulses. It waits. It calls to you."
