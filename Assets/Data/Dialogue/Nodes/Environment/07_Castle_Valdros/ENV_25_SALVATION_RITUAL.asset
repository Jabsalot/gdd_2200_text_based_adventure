  dialogueText: "You raise the vial of lamb's blood in one hand, the seer's eyes
    in the other. The words Father Aldric taught you rise unbidden to your lips \u2014
    old words, older than the kingdom, words that taste like ash and hope. The king
    screams. The crown screams louder. Light blazes from your hands \u2014 not the
    sick pulse of the crown but something cleaner, something that burns. The crown
    cracks. Shatters. Falls from the king's head in pieces. And King Aldric, for
    the first time in years, breathes."
