  dialogueText: "The throne room is vast and ruined. Tattered banners hang from a
    ceiling lost in shadow. The floor is cracked, weeds growing through stone. And
    there, on the iron throne, sits King Aldric. He was handsome once \u2014 you
    can see it in the bones of his face. Now he's gaunt, hollow, his skin stretched
    tight over a skull that seems too large. The Hollow Crown sits heavy on his brow,
    pulsing with a light that isn't light. His eyes find you. \"Another one,\" he
    whispers. \"Another assassin. Another savior. Which are you, I wonder?\""
