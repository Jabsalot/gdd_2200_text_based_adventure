  dialogueText: "He laughs \u2014 a dry, rattling sound. \"Help me? No one can help
    me. The crown won't let them. It whispers, you know. All the time. Every thought
    I have, it answers. Every doubt, it confirms. Every fear, it feeds.\" He grips
    the armrests, knuckles white. \"I ordered my wife killed. Did you know that?
    The crown said she was plotting against me. She wasn't. She was just afraid.
    Like everyone else. Like me.\" His eyes clear for a moment. \"If you've come
    to help... do it quickly. Before the crown notices.\""
