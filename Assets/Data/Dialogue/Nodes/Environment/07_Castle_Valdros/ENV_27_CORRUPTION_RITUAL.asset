  dialogueText: "The Void inside you responds to your call, surging up through your
    chest and out through your eyes. Black tendrils of nothing pour from your hands,
    wrapping around the king, sinking into his flesh. He doesn't scream \u2014 he
    can't. The crown flares, trying to fight back, but the Void is older, hungrier,
    stronger. Through your connection, you feel the Seer's consciousness riding your
    power, sliding into the king's broken mind. \"Thank you, child,\" she whispers
    \u2014 from your mouth, from his, from everywhere at once. \"You've given me
    exactly what I needed.\""
