  dialogueText: "You lift the Hollow Crown with trembling hands. The void essence
    within you sings in recognition. This was always meant to be. As the crown settles
    upon your brow, you feel the power flooding through you\u2014ancient, terrible,
    absolute. The corruption doesn't consume you. You consume it. When you open your
    eyes, you see the world as it truly is: small, fragile, waiting to be shaped.
    Brother Aldous was right. You have become more than mortal. You have become a
    god."
