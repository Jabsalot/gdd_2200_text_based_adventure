  dialogueText: "The Void pours through you, a river of darkness flooding into the
    king's broken mind. You feel the Seer riding your power, sliding into his flesh
    like a hand into a glove. Aldric's screams cut off abruptly. When he opens his
    eyes again, they're not his eyes anymore. They're not anyone's eyes. \"At last.\"
    The Seer speaks through the king's mouth, but her voice echoes from everywhere
    \u2014 from you, from the walls, from the crown itself. \"Fifty years in chains.
    Fifty years of patience. And now...\" The king's body rises, joints cracking,
    muscles remembering movements they never learned. \"Now I have a kingdom.\" She
    turns to you, and though you're standing behind the throne, those borrowed eyes
    find you anyway. \"You did well, little servant. I'll remember that.\" The Hollow
    Crown pulses on Aldric's brow \u2014 no, on her brow now. It doesn't fight her.
    It welcomes her. It recognizes something kindred. Something worse."
