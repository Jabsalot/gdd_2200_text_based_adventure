  dialogueText: "The kingdom doesn't fall. That would be too merciful. Instead, it
    transforms. The Blind Seer rules through the king's body, issuing decrees that
    seem benevolent at first \u2014 feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, ending
    the executions. But something is wrong. The villagers smile too wide. The children
    don't play. The dogs don't bark. Everyone moves in perfect harmony, perfect obedience,
    perfect emptiness. You stand at the Seer's right hand, her faithful servant,
    rewarded with power you never wanted and can never refuse. Sometimes, in the
    dark of night, you hear the old king screaming inside his own skull, trapped
    forever in the prison of his flesh. Sometimes you hear the priests you murdered,
    asking why. Sometimes you hear your own voice, asking what you've become. The
    Seer hears it too. She finds it amusing. THE END \u2014 CORRUPTION"
