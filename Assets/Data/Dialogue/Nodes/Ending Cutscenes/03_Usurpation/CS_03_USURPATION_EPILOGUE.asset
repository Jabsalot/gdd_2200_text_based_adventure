  dialogueText: "They call you the Stranger King. The one who came from nowhere,
    killed a tyrant, and claimed his throne. Some say you're a hero. Others whisper
    that you're worse than Aldric ever was. Both might be right. You rule fairly,
    at first. The crown's whispers are easy to ignore when they suggest cruelty,
    harder when they suggest efficiency. Harder still when they start making sense.
    Rook's sacrifice bought you clarity, but clarity fades. Every year, the whispers
    grow louder. Every year, your reflection looks a little less like you. In the
    village square of Ashwick, they've built a statue in your honor. You had them
    tear it down. Heroes don't deserve statues. Neither do the things you're becoming.
    The crown sits heavy on your brow, and sometimes you dream of a stranger walking
    into your throne room, blade in hand, ready to end what you've become. You hope
    they're stronger than you were. You hope they don't fail. THE END \u2014 USURPATION"
