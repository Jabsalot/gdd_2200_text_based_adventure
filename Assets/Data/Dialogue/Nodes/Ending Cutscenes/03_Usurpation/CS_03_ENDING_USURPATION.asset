  dialogueText: "You reach down and lift the Hollow Crown from the blood-soaked floor.
    It's lighter than you expected. Heavier than you feared. Aldric's headless body
    slumps on the throne, finally at peace. The crown whispers to you \u2014 promises
    of power, of glory, of eternal rule. You can feel the madness scratching at the
    edges of your mind, eager to begin its work. But Rook's blood holds it at bay.
    His willing sacrifice bought you time. Not immunity \u2014 the crown will never
    stop trying \u2014 but time. Years, perhaps. Decades if you're strong. You settle
    onto the iron throne and place the crown upon your head. It fits perfectly. You
    wonder if it was made for you. You wonder if you were made for it. Outside, the
    sun rises on a kingdom with a new ruler. Whether you'll be better than the last
    one or worse remains to be seen. The crown whispers suggestions. Some of them
    might be your own thoughts. You're not sure anymore."
