  dialogueText: "The light fades. The crown lies in pieces on the floor, its hunger
    finally silenced. King Aldric collapses, gasping, weeping, suddenly mortal again.
    \"What... what have I done?\" His voice is his own for the first time in years.
    Small. Human. Broken. He remembers everything \u2014 every execution, every decree,
    every life destroyed by his corrupted hands. \"Isolde,\" he whispers. \"I killed
    her. I killed them all.\" You help him to his feet. He's frail now, shrunken,
    the weight of kingship crushing him more than the crown ever did. But he's free.
    The kingdom is free. The healing will take years, decades, perhaps longer. The
    scars will never fully fade. But as dawn breaks through the shattered windows
    of the throne room, you see something in the king's eyes you thought was lost
    forever: hope. It's not enough. It will never be enough. But it's a start."
