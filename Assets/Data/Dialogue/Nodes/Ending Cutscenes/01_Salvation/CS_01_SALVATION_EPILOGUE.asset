  dialogueText: "In the weeks that follow, King Aldric abolishes the crown's authority.
    He cannot undo what was done, but he tries \u2014 releasing prisoners, pardoning
    the falsely accused, opening the royal coffers to rebuild what was destroyed.
    Father Aldric returns to the castle, no longer a drunk but a confessor once more,
    helping the king bear the weight of his sins. You are offered titles, lands,
    rewards. You refuse them all. The kingdom needs its resources for healing, not
    for honoring the stranger who saved it. As you leave Ashwick for the last time,
    you pass the fountain in the square. Someone has carved a new face on the Pale
    Saint \u2014 crude, simple, but unmistakably hopeful. It's not much. But in a
    kingdom that nearly fell to darkness, it's everything. THE END \u2014 SALVATION"
