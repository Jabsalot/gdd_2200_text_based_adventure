  dialogueText: "You bring the crown down against the iron throne, again and again,
    until nothing remains but twisted fragments. With each blow, you feel the corruption
    dissipating, screaming into the void from which it came. The monarchy dies with
    King Aldric. In the months that follow, a council forms\u2014Vex among its leaders.
    They call you Kingslayer. Some say it as a curse, others as a blessing. You accept
    both. The old order is gone. What rises from its ashes... that remains to be
    seen."
